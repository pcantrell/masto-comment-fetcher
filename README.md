# Mastodon Comment Fetcher

This is the code that fetches Mastodon posts to display as comments on [blogs on innig.net](https://innig.net/teaching/liberal-arts-manifesto).

This code has a few dependencies on larger context not present here, and is unlikely to run in isolation. I share it only is case it provides useful recipes for others looking to accomplish similar tasks.
